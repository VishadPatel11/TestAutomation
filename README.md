# TestAutomation
This is my self teaching lessons from online tutorials on selenium webdriver using Java.  
I have added a MVC model to a GUI I built. 
The intended functionalty is to be able to script a web based application for automation using this tool with the selelnium webdriver. 
This is very raw and a complete work in progress. 


Cheers!
